**Motivation for the project:**

In this project, I will analyze some key aspects to consider before searching for the next programming job. As a data scientist, I will rely on the data gathered from developers around the world to find these factors. I am going to use stack overflow developer survey 2020 dataset for this article.Â 

**Questions**

I will focus my analysis on the following questions:

1. Which language is most popular in the programming industry?
2. Which location offers the most jobs for the developers?
3. Which category has the most number of jobs?
4. What is the average salary of different job categories?

**Libraries used**

The libraries required for running the project are mentioned in req.txt. In order to install all the libraries, please run the command:
pip install -r req.txt

The Anaconda distribution of Python is necessary for running the code. I have used Python 3.

**Dataset:**

I have used The stack overflow developer survey 2020 data. It is available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).

**Files in the repository:**

1. reqs.txt: description of the libraries used in the project
2. write_blog_post-checkpoint.ipynb: notebook containing code for analysis
3. README.md: current document.

**Summary of the analysis:**

The summarized analysis from this project have been published in a [medium blog post](https://jyoti-islam.medium.com/how-to-find-your-next-programming-job-let-the-data-decide-86833db71807).
